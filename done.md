# HummingbirdPantry â€” Session Summary (2025-09-14)

## What we changed (core-first, Neon-first)

- BarcodeScanner stream reuse (single-gesture compliant)
  - Updated `src/components/barcode/BarcodeScanner.tsx` so `startScanning()` reuses the click-acquired `initialStream`/existing stream and only calls `getUserMedia` when no stream exists.
- Single scanner path (provider-driven)
  - `ScannerProvider` remains the sole render path; legacy direct render was removed earlier; we kept it that way.
- Server-first scan pipeline
  - In `src/App.tsx`, the scan callback now tries Neon first. If increment succeeds, we close; on any miss/error we open `AddItemModal` with prefill from cache/OFF/mock.
- Background sync disabled
  - Removed background sync initialization from `src/App.tsx` to avoid side effects and ensure Neon-first behavior is observable.

## Files edited this session

- `src/components/barcode/BarcodeScanner.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`

## Observed after changes (user-reported)

- Chrome: double overlay still present
- Firefox: modal not autofilling
- Safari: product modal appears but does not autofill
- NeonDB: not perceived as source of truth across browsers

## Likely remaining gaps

- Scanner overlay duplication: module-level `activeScannerCount` guard may interfere; provider already ensures singleton. Remove the guard to avoid blocked/duplicate states.
- Base URL gating: the scan flow should attempt server ops whenever a base URL exists; do not wait on `dbOk` which may be stale/null during early startup.
- Minor hygiene/lints: keep `openScanner` callback in sync with `dbOk`; add missing deps to `startScanning` useCallback; log resolved base URL once on startup to confirm runtime resolver.

## Next steps (surgical)

- Remove `activeScannerCount`/`blocked` guard from `BarcodeScanner.tsx` (provider ensures single instance)
- Add `dbOk` to `openScanner` dependency list and log resolved API base URL once on app init
- Satisfy linter on `startScanning` by adding missing dependencies

- **Success metrics crucial**: Clear goals help measure progress and success

### Development Philosophy
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core features work without advanced APIs
- **Graceful degradation**: App remains functional when features fail
- **User-centric design**: Mobile-first with accessibility as priority
- **Performance first**: Optimize for real-world usage patterns
