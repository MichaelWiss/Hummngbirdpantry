## Recently Completed Tasks

### Project Documentation & Planning
*All documentation tasks have been completed as part of the initial project planning phase*

### 2025-09-05 - Security & Tooling
- [x] **Removed committed dev TLS private key & certificate**
  - **Implementation details**: Deleted `key.pem` / `cert.pem`, added `.gitignore` patterns
  - **Files modified**: `.gitignore`, removed key/cert
  - **Key decisions**: Enforce local-only generation
- [x] **Hardened HTTPS dev configuration**
  - **Implementation details**: Env var overrides `VITE_HTTPS_CERT_PATH` / `VITE_HTTPS_KEY_PATH`, graceful fallback
  - **Files modified**: `vite.config.ts`
- [x] **Added secret scanning pre-commit hooks**
  - **Implementation details**: `detect-secrets` baseline + PEM blocker hook
  - **Files created**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.secrets.baseline`
- [x] **Created security and remediation docs**
  - **Docs**: `SECURITY.md`, `ROTATE_KEYS.md`, `docs/secrets-scanning.md`, `docs/local-https.md`, updated `cert.README.md`
- [x] **Added comprehensive README**
  - **Focus**: Current architecture, security steps, roadmap
- [x] **Modularized barcode scanner UI**
  - **Implementation**: Extracted viewport, overlay, permission, ready, insecure context banner components
  - **Next**: Extract diagnostics + integrate `useBarcodeZxing`
- [x] **Introduced permission & ZXing hooks**
  - **Hooks**: `useCameraPermissions`, `useBarcodeZxing` (initial)
  - **Benefit**: Simplifies orchestrator testing & state isolation

### 2025-09-05 - Barcode Scanner Stability Rollback & Fix
- [x] **Restored reliable camera feed across browsers (Chrome primary; Safari overlay artifact resolved)**
  - **Problem**: Refactor introduced multi-phase initialization (preflight getUserMedia + ZXing start + restarts) causing black/ flashing video and duplicate overlays; Safari/Firefox showed live track without rendered frames (0Ã—0 dimensions) and IndexSizeError spam.
  - **Root Causes**:
    - Early permission stream stopped before ZXing attached its own â†’ race leaving video element without srcObject.
    - Reader resets / fallback timers during attachment window.
    - Overlay duplication from multiple mounts / layered focus frames creating double-border illusion (Safari).
  - **Solution**: Replaced layered logic with a minimal deterministic pipeline:
    1. Single getUserMedia acquisition (environment facingMode hint).
    2. Bind stream directly to video; wait loadedmetadata.
    3. Start continuous decode via `BrowserMultiFormatReader.decodeFromVideoElementContinuously` (no device re-open).
    4. Simplified state (isInitializing, isScanning, hasPermission); removed restarts, polling, activation fallback, diagnostics interval.
    5. Simplified `ScannerOverlay` to a single border + scan bar; added `pointer-events-none`.
  - **Files Modified**: `src/components/barcode/BarcodeScanner.tsx`, `src/components/barcode/ui/ScannerOverlay.tsx`.
  - **Key Decisions**: Prefer stability-first baseline; postpone advanced features until after verified multi-browser feed.
  - **Testing**: Verified live feed and decoding on Chrome; Safari double-border removed after overlay simplification; awaiting extended Firefox/Safari decode verification.
  - **Next Steps**: (Deferred) Single-shot mode toggle, device switch UI, decode throttling, re-introduction of diagnostics behind a flag.
