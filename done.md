## Task Completion Template

When moving tasks from `tasks.md` to this file, use the following format:

### [Date Completed] - Phase.Task Category
- [x] **Task Name** - Brief description of implementation
  - **Implementation details**: Technical approach and architecture decisions
  - **Files modified**: List of files created/modified
  - **Key decisions**: Important architectural or design choices
  - **Testing completed**: Test coverage and validation approach
  - **Performance impact**: Any performance considerations or optimizations

Example:
### 2024-01-15 - Phase 1.Project Infrastructure
- [x] **Initialize React 18 + TypeScript + Vite project** - Set up modern React development environment
  - **Implementation details**: Used Vite for fast HMR, configured TypeScript with strict mode, set up path aliases
  - **Files modified**: `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`
  - **Key decisions**: Chose Vite over CRA for better performance, enabled strict TypeScript for type safety
  - **Testing completed**: Verified build process and TypeScript compilation
  - **Performance impact**: Improved development speed with fast hot reload

## Project Metrics & Health

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% (requirements, style guide, tasks completed)
- **TypeScript Coverage**: 0% (target: 100% in Phase 2)
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (target: 85% by Phase 6)
- **Bundle Size**: Not yet measured (target: <200KB gzipped)
- **Performance Score**: Not yet measured (target: 90+ Lighthouse)

### Development Progress
- **Total Tasks**: 200+ across 8 phases
- **Estimated Timeline**: 16-20 weeks total development
- **Risk Level**: Medium (voice/camera APIs need careful testing)
- **Complexity Level**: High (advanced features with multiple integrations)

### Feature Readiness
- **Core Pantry**: 0% complete (Phase 2)

- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **State Management**: Context + useReducer (Zustand optional for complex state)
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for accessibility and consistency
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright for comprehensive coverage

### Mobile-First Approach
- **Primary Target**: iPhone Safari with PWA capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with progressive enhancement
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile networks and device capabilities
- **Offline Support**: Service worker with background sync

### Advanced Feature Strategy
- **Voice Recognition**: Web Speech API with fallbacks
- **Camera Integration**: @zxing/library for barcode scanning
- **API Integration**: Multiple providers with caching and error handling
- **Data Storage**: IndexedDB for complex data, localStorage for settings

## Current Blockers & Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Start Phase 1**: Initialize React + TypeScript project structure
2. **Set up development environment**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky
3. **Configure design system**: Tailwind + Radix UI
4. **Install core dependencies**: React ecosystem and advanced libraries

### Potential Risks to Monitor
- **iOS Compatibility**: Voice and camera APIs may have iOS-specific limitations
- **API Dependencies**: External services (recipe APIs, barcode lookup) may have rate limits
- **Performance**: Advanced features (voice processing, image recognition) need optimization
- **Browser Support**: Ensuring compatibility across iOS versions

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### Documentation Phase Insights
- **Comprehensive planning pays off**: Detailed requirements prevent scope creep
- **Phased approach works**: Breaking into manageable phases reduces overwhelm
- **Risk assessment important**: Identifying potential issues early allows mitigation
- **Success metrics crucial**: Clear goals help measure progress and success

### Development Philosophy
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core features work without advanced APIs
- **Graceful degradation**: App remains functional when features fail
- **User-centric design**: Mobile-first with accessibility as priority
- **Performance first**: Optimize for real-world usage patterns
