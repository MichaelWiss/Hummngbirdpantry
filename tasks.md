## Recent Regression Report (2025-09-05) - Barcode Scanner

### Diagnosis Summary
- Symptoms: Black/flash video, 0×0 video dimensions, IndexSizeError logs, duplicate overlay appearance (Safari), inconsistent auto-start.
- Root Causes:
  1. Multi-stage init (permission preflight stream stopped before ZXing attach) introduced race where video never received a bound stream.
  2. Redundant activation fallback & restart timers resetting the ZXing reader during attachment.
  3. Overlay duplication illusion from nested focus frame + strict/dev double mount behavior.
  4. Continuous decode attempted on a video element with zero dimensions → transient canvas read errors.

### Resolution Steps
1. Removed preflight + restart logic; single deterministic getUserMedia → bind → loadedmetadata wait.
2. Switched to `decodeFromVideoElementContinuously` to avoid device re-open timing issues.
3. Simplified state and removed diagnostics interval / fallback timers.
4. Consolidated overlay to a single layer (no nested frame) + pointer-events-none.
5. Added clear documentation of causes & deferred enhancements.

### Remaining / Deferred Enhancements
- Optional single-shot barcode mode (auto-stop after first decode).
- Camera/device switcher UI.
- Optional diagnostics flag for future debugging.
- Fallback constraint negotiation for older Safari / Firefox edge cases if reported.
