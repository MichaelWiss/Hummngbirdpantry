# HummingbirdPantry ‚Äì Core-First Tasks (Neon as Source of Truth)

## Sprint: Make Main Feature Robust (Neon-first, Robust MVP)

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES (From requirements.md)

### Core Requirements (Non-negotiables)
- **üîµ Neon-First**: All CRUD writes go to Neon (Postgres) first. Neon is the single source of truth.
- **üîµ Server-First**: If Neon unreachable, surface error immediately. No silent local-only fallbacks.
- **üîµ Single-Flight Scanner**: Scanner opens once, stays open during decode churn. App-level guard prevents duplicates.
- **üîµ Server-First Product Resolution**: On scan miss ‚Üí Local cache ‚Üí Server GET ‚Üí OFF lookup ‚Üí Manual form.

### Implementation Guidelines
- **‚úÖ DO**: Surface Neon connection failures immediately with visible banners
- **‚ùå DON'T**: Implement silent fallbacks that mask actual problems
- **‚úÖ DO**: Use same code path for all browsers with simple feature detection
- **‚ùå DON'T**: Implement browser-specific workarounds without understanding root cause
- **‚úÖ DO**: Server state drives UI; local state is ephemeral read-through cache
- **‚ùå DON'T**: Complex state synchronization between local and server stores

### MVP Scope Boundaries
- **IN SCOPE**: Scan ‚Üí resolve product ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Confirmed in Neon ‚Üí Reflected in UI
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: Offline write queue, voice/photo recognition, shopping lists, advanced PWA features
- **DEFERRED**: Advanced features until core Neon-first workflow is proven robust

### Blocking Bugs (to fix before any new features)
- [ ] Scanner overlays duplicate in Chrome/Firefox
  - Root cause: multiple open triggers without a single-flight guard at App level.
  - Fix: centralize `openScanner()` in `App.tsx`; ignore while open/opening; ensure only one render path for `BarcodeScanner`.
  - Acceptance:
    - Rapid taps on any scan button yield exactly one overlay across Chrome/Firefox/Safari.
    - No duplicate camera streams; closing the modal releases tracks.

- [ ] Safari does not autofill after scan (Save disabled)
  - Root cause: server-first barcode lookup not used to prefill before OFF/manual.
  - Fix: on scan miss ‚Üí Local ‚Üí Server GET `/api/products/:barcode` ‚Üí OFF ‚Üí Manual; prefill from server/OFf result.
  - Acceptance:
    - If server has item, form prefills (or increments without form) and Save is enabled.
    - If not found, OFF prefills; if still not found, manual form with barcode prefilled.

- [ ] Firefox skips autofilling form
  - Root cause: scan flow bypasses prefill path on some branches.
  - Fix: unify scan handler to the same Local ‚Üí Server ‚Üí OFF ‚Üí Manual pipeline.
  - Acceptance:
    - First valid scan in Firefox follows the same prefill/auto-increment behavior as Chrome/Safari.

- [ ] Browsers not querying NeonDB consistently
  - Root cause: local-only fallbacks masking API failures; writes not visibly failing; env/CORS variance.
  - Fix: Neon-first repository writes (already applied); on failure show banner and block local mutation; verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and server CORS.
  - Acceptance:
    - Writes hit Neon (visible in server logs/Neon) or surface a user-visible error.
    - Reload in another browser reflects the same quantities.

### 1) Scanner: Single-Flight + Stable Decode
- [ ] Centralize `openScanner()` in `App.tsx`; ignore while open/opening.
- [ ] Keep one `BarcodeScanner` render path only.
- [ ] In scanner: ignore transient decode errors; only fatal camera/permission errors surface.
- [ ] Ensure tracks stop on close/unmount.

### 2) Server-First Product Resolution
- [ ] On scan miss: Local ‚Üí GET `/api/products/:barcode` ‚Üí OFF ‚Üí Manual.
- [ ] Prefill from server hit to enable Save; optionally auto-increment via PATCH.

### 3) Neon-First CRUD (No Queue)
- [ ] `ProductRepository.upsert`: call server; persist returned row locally; update store.
- [ ] `ProductRepository.increment`: server PATCH; persist returned row; update store.
- [ ] `ProductRepository.update`: server PUT; persist returned row; update store.
- [ ] `ProductRepository.remove`: server DELETE first; then delete locally and update store.
- [ ] On failure: show error; do not mutate local.

### 4) Startup Data Flow
- [ ] On app start: fetch from server; on success, replace store; on failure show banner.
- [ ] Avoid silent local-only mode.

### 5) Environment & CORS
- [ ] Confirm `VITE_API_BASE_URL` available in all deploy environments.
- [ ] Server `CORS_ORIGIN` includes Cloudflare Pages origin.

### 6) Verification (Manual)
- [ ] Chrome/Firefox/Safari: single overlay; no mid-scan closure on decode noise.
- [ ] Add item ‚Üí visible in Neon; reload in another browser shows it.
- [ ] Increment/edit/delete ‚Üí reflected immediately in Neon + UI.

## Deferred (after MVP proven)
- [ ] Re-enable offline queue with single-flight + exponential backoff.
- [ ] Add idempotency keys to POST/increment/PUT.
- [ ] Consider changed-since reconciliation after flush.

## üö´ DEFERRED FEATURES (Out of MVP Scope)

### Phase 2.5: Voice & Photo Features (DEFERRED)
**Status**: Explicitly out of scope for MVP per requirements.md
**Rationale**: Core focus is robust Neon-first barcode scanning and pantry management

#### Voice Recognition (Web Speech API) - DEFERRED
- [ ] Voice input control with start/stop and visual feedback
- [ ] Dictation pipeline to add items; error messages per error type
- [ ] Mocks for testing voice flows in CI

#### Photo Capture & OCR (MVP) - DEFERRED
- [ ] Photo capture view (separate from scanner); resource cleanup
- [ ] OCR pipeline (client‚Äëside where possible); extract name/brand/qty
- [ ] Manual correction form; save to DB

### Phase 3: Shopping & Chat Systems (DEFERRED)
**Status**: Explicitly out of scope for MVP per requirements.md
**Rationale**: "Everything else is optional" - focus on core scan/add/update/delete workflow

#### Shopping Lists - DEFERRED
- [ ] Generate list from low stock/expiring soon
- [ ] Aisles/sections ordering; drag‚Äëand‚Äëdrop reordering
- [ ] Mark purchased; archive history

#### iOS Secure‚ÄëContext Enablement (IN SCOPE)
- [ ] Device‚Äëtrusted HTTPS guide and checklist (dev only)
- [ ] App copy explaining iOS WebKit limitations on HTTP/LAN IP
- [ ] Verification checklist (camera + IndexedDB work on device)


## Phase 5: Data Management & APIs

### IndexedDB & Services
- [ ] DB versioning + migrations; error handling for blocked/upgrade
- [ ] `products` store APIs (getById, getByBarcode, list, put, delete)
- [ ] `offlineQueue` APIs and background processing

### Server APIs (if/when available)
- [ ] `/api/products` CRUD; schema validation
- [ ] Barcode lookup proxy with caching/budget limits
- [ ] Error taxonomy and retry/backoff policy


## Phase 6: Testing & Quality Assurance

### Unit & Integration
- [ ] Hooks: pantry, scanner, products services (85%+ coverage targets later)
- [ ] Components: scanner modal, add item modal, pantry list
- [ ] Storage: IndexedDB service with mocks

### E2E (Playwright)
- [ ] Happy path: scan ‚Üí product ‚Üí save ‚Üí appears in pantry
- [ ] Fallback path: scan fail ‚Üí manual entry ‚Üí save
- [ ] Offline path: save queued ‚Üí sync on reconnect

### Cross‚ÄëPlatform
- [ ] iOS Safari device (secure context) acceptance
- [ ] Desktop Chrome/Firefox parity checks


## Phase 7: Performance & Optimization

### App‚Äëlevel
- [ ] Code splitting/lazy load scanner and heavy views
- [ ] Keep initial bundle under target budget (<200KB gz)
- [ ] Measure and reduce layout shifts on mobile

### Scanner‚Äëspecific
- [ ] Decode latency budget (~2s in good light)
- [ ] Constraint negotiation metrics (how often fallbacks are used)
- [ ] Memory and track cleanup verified (no leaks across open/close cycles)


## Phase 8: Documentation & Deployment

### Docs
- [ ] README: setup, HTTPS on device, known limitations, troubleshooting
- [ ] Component READMEs for scanner and data services
- [ ] Change log and migration notes for DB version bumps

### Deployment
- [ ] CI: lint, typecheck, tests, build
- [ ] CD: artifact upload; environment config; secrets policy
- [ ] Observability hooks (minimal): error reporting toggles


## Risk Register (Live)
- iOS WebKit secure‚Äëcontext requirement blocks camera/IndexedDB on HTTP/LAN IP ‚Üí Mitigate with device‚Äëtrusted HTTPS and clear banners.
- Provider rate limits/coverage gaps for barcode lookup ‚Üí Cache + manual entry fallback.
- Camera constraints vary across devices ‚Üí Robust fallback path and telemetry.


## Definitions of Done (DoD)
- Feature meets acceptance criteria, has tests, cleans up resources, and is documented.
- No new ESLint/TypeScript errors; lints/tests pass in CI.
- Mobile UX verified on iPhone; accessible announcements included.


## Appendix: Recent Regression (2025‚Äë09‚Äë05) ‚Äì Barcode Scanner

### Symptoms
- Black/flash video, 0√ó0 dimensions, `IndexSizeError`, duplicate overlay (Safari), inconsistent auto‚Äëstart.

### Root Causes
1) Preflight stream stopped before ZXing attach ‚Üí race leaving video without `srcObject`.
2) Restart timers resetting reader during attach window.
3) Overlay duplication illusion from nested frames + strict/dev double mount.
4) Decode attempted on 0√ó0 video ‚Üí transient canvas read errors.

### Resolutions
- Single deterministic pipeline: getUserMedia ‚Üí bind ‚Üí wait `loadedmetadata` ‚Üí continuous decode.
- Remove restart/polling; simplify overlay to single layer; `pointer-events: none`.
- Document causes; defer advanced features behind flags.

### Deferred Enhancements
- Single‚Äëshot barcode mode, device switcher, diagnostics flag, extended fallback constraints.

## Recent Regression Report (2025-09-05) - Barcode Scanner

### Diagnosis Summary
- Symptoms: Black/flash video, 0√ó0 video dimensions, IndexSizeError logs, duplicate overlay appearance (Safari), inconsistent auto-start.
- Root Causes:
  1. Multi-stage init (permission preflight stream stopped before ZXing attach) introduced race where video never received a bound stream.
  2. Redundant activation fallback & restart timers resetting the ZXing reader during attachment.
  3. Overlay duplication illusion from nested focus frame + strict/dev double mount behavior.
  4. Continuous decode attempted on a video element with zero dimensions ‚Üí transient canvas read errors.

### Resolution Steps
1. Removed preflight + restart logic; single deterministic getUserMedia ‚Üí bind ‚Üí loadedmetadata wait.
2. Switched to `decodeFromVideoElementContinuously` to avoid device re-open timing issues.
3. Simplified state and removed diagnostics interval / fallback timers.
4. Consolidated overlay to a single layer (no nested frame) + pointer-events-none.
5. Added clear documentation of causes & deferred enhancements.

### Remaining / Deferred Enhancements
- Optional single-shot barcode mode (auto-stop after first decode).
- Camera/device switcher UI.
- Optional diagnostics flag for future debugging.
- Fallback constraint negotiation for older Safari / Firefox edge cases if reported.

## Development Workflow & Best Practices
- [ ] Maintain clean git history with squashed merges
- [ ] Documentation is updated with each feature implementation
- [ ] Performance regression testing before deployments
- [ ] Code reviews for all architectural changes
- [ ] Automated testing for critical user paths
